      <li><h2>Major Project</h2></li>
        <h3><u>Internet Based Automated Poultry Farm</u></h3>
          <p><strong> February 2019 â€“ May 2019</strong>
            <br>
          This project aims to provide details on how to build an automated Environment Controlled Poultry Management System using Raspberry Pi and Arduino-Uno board for interfacing with different sensors. I was the head of the project and my role is Arduino part of coding.</p>

          <li><h3><u>Robotic Car using Arduino Uno</u></h3></li>
          <p><strong>October 2017</strong>
            <br>
            In this project the movement of the robotic car is controller using Arduino Uno microcontroller and Bluetooth. I was the head of the project and my role is Arduino part of coding.</p>
          <li><h3><u>Design and Fabrication on PCB</u></h3></li>
          <p><strong>February 2018</strong>
            <br>
            The temperature sensor circuit was designed using EAGLE software and fabricated on printed circuit Board.

          <li><h3><u>Soil Moisture Sensor using Arduino Uno</u></h3></li>
          <p><strong>February 2018</strong>
            <br>
            In the project conducted, the moisture content in the soil is detected using moisture sensor and Arduino. When the moisture rating in the soil is less than the limit then automatically the motor turns on by pouring water into the soil. I was the head of project and my role is Arduino part of coding
